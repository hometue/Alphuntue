<h1>Alphuntue</h1>
<p>Alphuntue is a tool used for moderating Model United Nations (or MUNs) debates. It is built on top of the Qt library. While there are other tools for this purpose, Alphuntue aims to be highly customizable, in terms of being able to add delegations and themes for different councils, allowing its users to easily adapt this tool for their purposes.</p>

As you can see, Alphuntue still has a long way to go, and it is any help will be appreciated, such as feedback, testing of Alphuntue, etc. 
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>A precompiled version of Alphuntue for Windows can be found in the git repository <a href="https://github.com/hometue/Alphuntue/raw/master/precompiled/release-Alphuntue.zip">here</a>. As of 6 April 2016, Alphuntue is at version Alpha 0.1, and while it is usable it may be buggy as it has not undergone much testing. Additionally, users will need to add in countries into Alphuntue manually by adding the names of those countries in alphabetical order into <b>country.txt</b>. Optional: Add in the country flag or image into the <b>img</b> folder, naming the image as <b>[Country name with capitalization and spacing].png</b>. This is a hassle and would be fixed in the future, most likely with the creation of a tool to automate such tasks.</p>
<h3>Licensing</h3>
<p>Definitely some open source license, will sort this out when I have the time to figure out the license used in Qt open source.</p>
